  but personally Iâ€™m not a fan of all of this. I already mentioned that my bottled-ember idea was to make it possible to have an empress app without being surrounded by the host ember app. I figured why not do something like that for V2 addons and make it possible to have the new fancy without needing to go so far as a monorepo.
