  so that is a whole lot of stuff, let me take you on the tour to simplify it a bit. the trick to understanding this screenshot is to know that the blueprint is using workspaces. you heard me right folks, the new proposed blueprint is a monorepo. now anyone that knows me knows that Iâ€™m not a fan of monorepos, but donâ€™t worry Iâ€™ll get to that.

  letâ€™s just look what we have here first. I'm going to switch to a better rendering of this structure to make it a bit easier to talk about.
