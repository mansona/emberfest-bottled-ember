  Mainmatter. If that’s a surprise for anyone that knows me, no I haven’t changed jobs recently, instead it’s my job that’s changed names. What used to be called simplabs is now called Mainmatter and I hopefully have updated all my socials to reflect that but let me know if you spot anything that I haven’t.

  Speeking of socials, you can tweet me at real_ate at any time about what I’m talking about today. I’m pretty passionate about this stuff so I’ll likely respond! Now that we have introductions out of the way, let’s see what I’m actually talking about today.
