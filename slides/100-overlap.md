  The way that this works is that it overlays certain known folders over the default app folder provided by bottled ember. so `app` and `tests` is overloaded on the botteld ember app. 

  that also means that we can create ourselves an acceptance test in the place that you might expect and we could run that too. It’s funny because this even feels a bit more convenient than being in a “real” ember app because you just don’t need to define any of the test boiler plate if you don’t need it to differ from what’s provided in the default template.
