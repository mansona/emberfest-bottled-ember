  so what’s the solution to these two problems? well again it’s Ed falkner to the rescue! This year Ed is helping us to earn our lightning speed scouts badge.
  
  by this stage you all must have heard about embroider. I don’t know all that much about it but the highest level summary is that it’s a next generation build system for ember apps that makes things a little bit less “magic”. part of the problems that we’ve had in ember is that we’ve been doing our own thing our own way that doesn’t fit in with the rest of the community’s tools. Embroider is an attempt to change that by better integrating with the wider community. one of the biggest things that are affected by this new ethos is the humble addon. The V2 addon spec dramatically simplifies the complexity of an ember-addon by defining a standard pre-built output that an addon needs to be published to npm as. that means that if all your provider addons are converted to this V2 format you just don’t need to buld them any more as part of your build step!
