  I have a little side project that I mentioned in my last EmberFest talk last year. Look at me there, I look so young and well rested 😭 but last year I had the idea that it might be useful to have whole ember app as a single dependency so that an Empress repo could just have markdown in it and essentially that single dependency, rather than being “surrounded” by a host Ember app with all random files in it.

### Generating Slides

Now that you have seen what slides can do, why don't you try to generate one now using the following:

```bash
ember generate slide "The Best Slide Ever"
```

That should create a new slide (with an automatic prefix).
