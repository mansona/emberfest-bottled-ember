  Today I'm talking about bottled-ember which is a little side project that I mentioned in my last EmberFest talk last year. Look at me there, I look so young and well rested 😭 but last year I had the idea that it might be useful to have whole ember app as a single dependency so that an Empress repo could just have markdown in it and essentially that single dependency, rather than being “surrounded” by a host Ember app with all random files in it.
