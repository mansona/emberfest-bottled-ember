  so let’s add bottled-ember together to this previous example before we converted it into a monorepo. the first thing you will need is to depend on `bottled-ember` as a dev dependency. ok now with that installed lets create a start script. Now the way bottled-ember works is that it creates a host app for you “behind the scenes”. The idea is that you don’t need to know anything about this and it should “just work”. We’ll see how far that goes over the coming months when I hope all of you try this out in your various projects.
