  so here we’re starting the ember app with serve and that’s all we need to do. When you run this I currently have it outputting a status of each of the steps that it’s doing. we can probably turn this off eventually. Also I have a plan to make this much quicker but we’ve already seen that it took me quite a while to get it to work this far!
