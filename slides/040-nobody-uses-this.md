  There are even some addons that can provideo you with actions or generators that hook into the ember command itself. When you run `ember serve` or `ember build` those are built in commands, but you can have a whole host of commands that are provided by addons. This ability of ember-addons is not very widely used, but one of the more famous ones is ember-cli deploy that provides the new `ember deploy` command. 

  Each addon can also provide a bunch of generators that may be sepecific to their use cased. there is a default generator that can run when the addon is first installed `with ember install` and then you can provide either specific new generators, like empress-blog providing a generator for posts, authors, or tags so files are setup in the right way. or you could have a specific generator that overrides one of the default ones like maybe your addon changes what a “component” should look like, so you provide a replacement.
