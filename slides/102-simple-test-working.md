  it works! It’s funny because this even feels a bit more convenient than being in a “real” ember app because you just don’t need to define any of the test boiler plate if you don’t need it to differ from what’s provided in the default template. 

  so this is one option available to you if you wanted to provide your own ember app and build everyting yourself. but what about the project I showed off last year at Ember Fest? field-guide! 

  it’s a pretty good project for documenting your addons. I’m hopefully going to convince anybody that’s currently using ember-cli-addon docs to swich over in the next 12 months, but we’ll see! we need to do something slightly different to get this running.
