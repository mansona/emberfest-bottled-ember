  An ember addon is like a special npm package that automatically integrates with your ember app. It can either provide some stuff that your app can make use of, like some components in the case of ember paper or any of the other component libraris out there

  slide with a few different libs

  or it could provide you with some helpers like the incredibly popular ember-truth-thelpers addon. bacically they can provide you anything that you could write in your own app.
