  Let’s also take a look at the source that this was generated from. Ok this is a bit better, tehre are at least some files in here. but there are a lot fewer of the nicities that we have come to expect from ember addons, there is no test dummy app that you can just run to have a demo of your app. and there are no tests that you can use that dummy app to exercise the components in your addon. 

  this is why the current draft or proposed blueprint doesn’t look like this folder strcutre. I’ve just simplified it to be exactly what you need to deploy your npm package. no the currently proposed blueprint look smore like this
