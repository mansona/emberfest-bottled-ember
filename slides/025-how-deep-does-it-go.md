  I was a bit torn on how deep of an expanation I should go into “what is an Ember addon”. In reality everyone here in the room or anyone watching the recording probably uses ember addons regularly, and we probably have quite a few addon authors in the room too. but for the sake of completeness I’ll go a little bit into the basics.
