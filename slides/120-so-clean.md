  and here it is now

  As you can see that is a lot better! essentially the only files that we have left are the markdown files that represent real actual content. there is one thing about this setup I don’t like, because this is an empress host app we don’t need to worry about things being in our dependencies blok of our package json. but for some reason I couldn’t get ember-cli to pick those up as addon dependencies if I put them in the package.json but I’m sure I’ll be able to trick it eventually
