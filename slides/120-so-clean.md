  here is a screenshot of my blog that I deployed on saturday using empress-blog and bottled ember

  As you can see it's so clean! essentially the only files that we have left are the markdown files that represent real actual content. There are still a few things to do to make this a tiny bit better but I'm very happy with it. There is a big psycological difference between having a little bit of a host ember app hanging around and having *nothing*
