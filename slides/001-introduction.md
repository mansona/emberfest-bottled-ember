  I have to say, it's really great to be back at emberfest, and it feels so good having so many people in the same room again. I've seen a lot of familiar faces and had a chance to meet some new awesome people. For anyone I haven't had a chance to chat to or anyone watching the video I'll do a bit of an intro:
